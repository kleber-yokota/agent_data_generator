- source_sentence: Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the verge of puberty, begins
    to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life--especially involving
    a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) who she meets in her dreams.<br /><br />Very
    unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments. Despite the fact that this
    is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating, this is NOT for children. Also,
    if you hate fantasies stay far away. But if you're game for something different
    this fits the bill.<br /><br />Well directed by Bernard Rose with a just beautiful
    music score and a few nice, scary jolts. The only thing that prevents this from
    being a really great movie is Burke--she's not a very good actress (it's no surprise
    that this has been her only film) and it hurts the movie. However, everybody else
    is just great.<br /><br />Spiers is very good as Mark; Glenne Headley (faking
    a British accent very well) is also very good as Anna's mother and Ben Cross is
    both frightening and sympathetic as Anna's father.<br /><br />A sleeper hit when
    released in 1988, it's since faded away. That's too bad--it's really very good.

  - '"Hatred of a Minute" is a hauntingly beautiful film. A psychological thriller
    that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial
    killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this
    film a "must see" for any film student or horror fan. The realness of the story
    and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies.
    Some shout outs to the film''s producer, Bruce Campbell as well as to the film
    "The Evil Dead" add some humor for anyone that knows the genre.'
  - 'There has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called Why We Fight,
    which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on
    this nation. It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against
    both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq. Yet,
    a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during World War
    Two, by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although considered documentaries, and
    having won Oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly
    mere agitprop, more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal''s Triumph Of The Will, scenes
    of which Capra recycles for his own purposes. That said, that fact does not mean
    it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two
    documentaries (such as the BBC''s lauded The World At War) lacked, nor does that
    mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. They are skillfully
    made, and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store, I found
    myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase. I chose Goodtimes
    DVD''s four DVD collection of the series.<br /><br />Rarely has something free
    been so worth invaluable. While there are no extras on the DVDs, and the sound
    quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of Americans
    two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic
    Warner Brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with
    blatant distortion of facts. The seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945,
    are Prelude To War, The Nazis Strike, Divide And Conquer, The Battle Of Britain,
    The Battle Of Russia, The Battle Of China, and War Comes To America.<br /><br
    />Overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons,
    but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms
    like X millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or
    the most overused graphic in the whole series- a Japanese sword piercing the center
    of Manchuria. Yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards
    to current wars. The lesson of World War One (avoid foreign entanglements) was
    not applicable to World War Two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships)
    has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since: Korea,
    Vietnam, nor Iraq. The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties
    of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today''s information-clogged
    times. It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of
    today, but at least you''ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous
    position, nor will you be the last.'
- source_sentence: Director/writer Andrés Waissbluth worked seven years to complete
    this two hour film about the crime underground in Santiago, Chile, and perhaps
    that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing.
    OR, maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir
    storytelling.<br /><br />Two brothers - Silvio the elder (Néstor Cantillana) and
    Victor the younger (Juan Pablo Miranda) - have moved to Santiago from their home
    in Temuco after their parents' death and Silvio works to support Victor's education.
    On Victor's seventeenth birthday Silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where
    he encourages Victor to lose his virginity with one of the club's stripper/prostitutes.
    In a tender scene Victor must face his nascent impotency while Silvio is out on
    the club floor impressing the 'owners' with his potential for hire.<br /><br />Silvio
    goes to work for the 'gang' as a bodyguard/henchman and makes good money to support
    Victor's schooling. But Victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named
    Gracia (Antonella Ríos) and begins to woo her, dropping out of school incurring
    Silvio's angry disappointment. Gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club
    gang's leader Don Pascual (Alejandro Trejo) who is Silvio's boss! Gracia is the
    glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of Victor, Silvio, and
    Don Pascual and the consequences of this bizarre ménage a trois has deadly results.
    Through a means of re-telling the story through the eyes of Victor, Silvio, and
    Gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character
    that allow for the downfall that results.<br /><br />Sound like a Chilean Pulp
    Fiction? Well, it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful, dark manner that
    includes a lot of frontal nudity (both female and male) and provocative sexual
    encounters. But in the end the sensual aspect of the director's vision is what
    drives this film, playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore
    professional sex worker with success. The cast is fairly strong, especially Antonella
    Ríos in the demanding role of Gracia. There are enough twists and turns and replays
    of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically
    in impact when told through the eyes of a different character. Bordering on two
    hours, some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film. In Spanish
    with English subtitles. Recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style
    and the art of South American cinema. Grady Harp
  sentences:
  - With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones,
    his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner
    Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt
    sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all
    the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and
    an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride.<br /><br />I got
    a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing
    factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment
    features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing
    a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture,
    like "We must have been dis-unconnected", but the one that had me rolling was
    his response to the criminal on board ship - "Self preservation is the last law
    of averages" - precisely!<br /><br />I'm not as great a student of Laurel and
    Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and
    find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count,
    "Saps At Sea" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.
  - 'This is a cute little horror spoof/comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira:
    Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. This was meant
    to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up
    by the NBC Network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the
    busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot
    stage due to it''s sexual references. This film however, is very amusing. Elvira
    is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one-liners. This film was
    followed up a few years later by the abysmal "Elvira''s Haunted Hills" which was
    meant to be a take-off of the old Roger Corman movies but falls flat on it''s
    face. Watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience!'
  - (No spoilers, just plot details) I can't understand such hatred for this episode.
    You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now there's
    a sack of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say that very often),
    and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. The alternate universe
    scenario seems eerily realistic. The Martian Manhunter, who previously appeared
    in "Static", returns and tells Clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane
    asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone,
    and if Clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill him. An overall great
    episode, with good acting and a decent pace.
- source_sentence: The real story (took place in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry
    and Dick, two ex-convicts who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal
    and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed the chilling and disturbing
    Capote's book about the reasons that drove these kids to the crime (Are they Natural

    lack of senses and reasons for what we witnessed. Stunning black & white cinematography

    performances in two principal roles from Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and first
    time in a movie a sad comment about capital punishment at the last moments before

    are Academy Award nominees. Gripping, superbly directed and frightening, one of
    the best films of this decade

    and another Embalmer''s fine recommendation.'
  - 'In the previews, "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" boasts the image of another immature
    sex romp about a 40-ish Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed
    simply because he hasn''t. Too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm
    to the point that he avoids women completely. And then the unexpected happens:
    he falls in love. What''s more, there''s a movie out about it, and it''s called
    "The 40 Year-old Virgin."<br /><br />The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve
    Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects
    vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad
    for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches "Survivor" with
    his two kind elderly neighbors. He''s a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely
    Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.<br /><br />Now here''s the
    real novelty with this picture: it does the impossible task of actually dealing
    with its subject matter in a cute, mature fashion. This is a movie that could
    very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent
    team of filmmakers. It could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but
    thankfully this picture never stoops that low. Sure there are sex jokes here and
    there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which are, in no way,
    meant to be taken as gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults towards
    each other while playing a video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception," no less - the
    ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys).<br /><br />As someone who is
    rapidly approaching 20, collects McFarlane Toys action figures AND has himself
    never done the deed, I found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed
    movie could never have been. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer
    more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this
    showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40. A bit arrogant, I know,
    but would you ("you" is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only
    teen present at an afternoon screening of "The 40 Year-Old Virgin"?<br /><br />Of
    course Andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with "morning rise" (don''t
    ask), and he''s pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining
    the attention of the opposite sex. When it''s first discovered Andy is a virgin,
    at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers David (Paul Rudd),
    Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all at first assume he''s gay because
    he''s never been with a woman, which couldn''t be any further from the truth.
    The truth is, Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously
    one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for
    good.<br /><br />David, Jay, and Cal each embark on a mission to get Andy laid,
    so help them all. But you know that such escapades will only end in disaster,
    as proved by one date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst
    drunk-driving experience I think anyone would not want to go through and he has
    a rather creepy encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works
    in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.<br /><br
    />Things brighten up for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly
    woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on eBay for people.
    Hmmm. And with that nice-looking collection of action figures, you can go figure
    that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him, that is if he can ever "do
    the deed."<br /><br />At last, this is the sex romp we''ve been waiting for. It
    deals with a very real issue a lot of Lonely Guys probably go through, not that
    anything is wrong with being a virgin but let''s look at the big picture: How
    many of us "Lonely Guys" want to be a lonely guy forever? The important thing
    we''re taught in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don''t think
    he needs to go through body waxing like Andy does (which is side-splitting to
    be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was
    in fact real, and so was the blood on Carell''s shirt afterward).<br /><br />"The
    40 Year-Old Virgin" was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by himself and
    Carell, which originated as a skit that starred Carell. Carell is sweet and human,
    as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes
    shut. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps I''ve ever seen and is
    not offensive (a whole lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and
    respect. Even Carell''s buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own
    relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.<br /><br
    />The way "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" plays out is indeed funny in the end, but I''ll
    leave that up to you, the viewer, to observe. Surely, if anyone can go through
    the things Andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as
    Catherine Keener, then it''s true: It is never too late!<br /><br />10/10'
  - Here we go with other slasher movie, Good looking people and Acting from everyone
    was really good!<br /><br />Few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents
    are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 Years after they are still friends,
    They go to huge house, have fun, Drugs and Sex (no nudity) for least half a hour
    of the movie! Again they start making pranks phone call all over again! and then
    killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with
    axe just like Urban Legend movie,<br /><br />Deaths scene really weird, really
    odd times too.<br /><br />Nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7/10 but
    the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless<br /><br
    />The twist killed the movie for me so I going to give it 4/10
- source_sentence: Back when musicals weren't showcases for choreographers, we had
    wonderful movies such as this one.<br /><br />Being a big fan of both Wodehouse
    and Fred Astaire I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not quite a blend
    of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville
    humour, the slapstick not the witty banter, clash with Wodehouse's British sense
    of humour. But on the whole, the American style banter makes the American characters
    seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.<br /><br />Some inventive staging
    for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors
    and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the
    top dance number. They seem a lot more realistic, if you could ever imagine people
    starting to sing and dance as realistic.<br /><br />The lack of Ginger Rogers
    and Eric Blore don't hurt the movie, instead they allow different character dynamics
    to emerge. It's also nice not to have a wise cracking, headstrong love interest.
    Instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest, far more in keeping with Wodehouses'
    young aristocratic females.

    \ The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds\

  - This was a delightful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played
    by the animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder.
    The quote (or scene) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of "all this plumbing
    ... you haven't learned my secrets at all" and threatens to storm out, the Scientist
    answers him in a single word "Thalassa" -- salt water which horrifies the Fiction
    Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood.
    <br /><br />Such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a
    classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released. Stimulating
    the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning.
  - You know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall
    from a clear blue sky. In fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric
    thriller, and only lawyer Chamberlain has the answer. But he's too much the European
    rationalist, I gather, to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals
    itself through dreams.<br /><br />Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics
    from director-writer Peter Weir. Already he had proved his skill at flirting with
    other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975). Here it's the arcane world
    of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of
    the predominant whites. Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community
    when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason. Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain
    is supposed to defend them in a white man's court. But the more he looks into
    things, the more mysterious things get, and the more interested a strange old
    Aboriginal man gets in him. And then there're those scary dreams that come and
    go at odd times.<br /><br />Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout.
    One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of Chamberlain's wife and
    little daughters. Audiences can readily identify with them. And when their little
    world runs into forces beyond the usual framework, the normalcy begins to buckle,
    and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide. Chamberlain underplays
    throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he
    should have shown more growing awareness than he does. After all, it's the picking
    up of the mask that holds the key (I believe) to the riddle, yet his reaction
    doesn't really register the revelation. <br /><br />Of course, the notion of nature
    striking back has a certain resonance now, thirty years later. In the film, the
    notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus, but the subject itself
    remains a telling one. One way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is
    the symbolism of the opening scene. A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal
    family, leaving them in the historical dust. The terrain looks like an interior
    tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where
    industry dwells. Yet, it's also a region most likely to survive anything like
    a destructive last wave. Perhaps there's something about past and future to think
    about here.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really good movie that will probably
    stay with you.
- source_sentence: My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY
    TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last
    twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least
    interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.<br /><br />David NIVEN and KIM
    HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives
    the liveliest and most credible performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is
    a delight (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger
    sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight.
    Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.<br /><br
    />Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think
    it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor
    photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way
    it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and
    effectiveness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer
    into the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator
    Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable
    romantic encounter. Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another triumph
    for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
  sentences:
  - Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself.
    Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere
    near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is, although it has to be
    one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen! Never bothered to post a comment
    on here before, but this piece of crap really warrants it. <br /><br />Firstly
    the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical. Brother of the lead character (either
    Ben or Arthur, I forget which is which, and frankly it's never very clear) wants
    to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality
    is abhorrent to Christians, but apparently mass murder isn't. Then there's some
    other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force him
    to remarry her at gunpoint. This leads to nothing, but provides us with one of
    the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole "film" - "I don't make sense? You
    don't make sense! That's who makes sense!". Brilliant.<br /><br />Then there's
    the acting, which is just atrocious. It must be seen to be believed. My personal
    favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading
    her lines off of something, yet still managing to mess them up. Enough said. The
    gay couple couldn't be less convincing. There's the vaguely attractive and completely
    gormless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of
    the bisto adverts. Only fatter. And less talented. <br /><br />The "film" has
    also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely
    still, and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing. The whole thing kicks
    off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on. Yep.<br /><br />But
    anyways, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I'd like to highlight some
    of the most priceless comedy moments that the "film" provides. <br /><br />- When
    the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl
    across the car park to make his escape. Hilarious.<br /><br />- Mildread! No idea
    what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes
    they don't, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless. Hilarious.<br /><br
    />- The stoned lawyer. Already mentioned her, but she's so funny she's worth another
    mention.<br /><br />- The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for
    his guests.<br /><br />- The evil brother's anti-gay potion.<br /><br />- The
    evil brother's cats.<br /><br />- The ending, which I won't give away because
    it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you though, make sure you're not eating
    at the time!!!! The tub of lard main character/director/producer gets naked. It's
    foul. <br /><br />Basically, Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally
    the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good
    about this excuse for a film, the goon of a director even manages to make the
    opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
  - Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one time military man
    who has retreated into a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and
    the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he?s going to hang
    it up. Things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention
    some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery.
    Its Dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death. Jaw dropping throw back
    to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as
    punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair. What a stupid movie. Watchable
    in a I can?t believe people made this sort of way, this is an action film that
    was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget, fake breakaway sets
    and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye. Watch how late
    in the film as cars drive through the school (don?t ask) they crash into the security
    turret (don?t ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school) and smash
    its barely constructed form apart(it doesn't look like it did in earlier shots).
    What hath the gods of bad movies wrought? Actually I?m perplexed since this was
    directed (?) by Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made films like The
    Boys in Company C. Has his ability failed him, or was this hopeless from the get
    go and he didn't even bother? It?s a turkey. A watchable one but a turkey none
    the less.
  - '"Match Point" and now "Scoop" have both convinced me that not only is Woody Allen
    doing a neat job making movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the
    right cast member), but corroborated what I have known for years: he shouldn''t
    focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays journalism student
    Sondra Pransky, whom magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his disappearing box,
    where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who
    tells her that the serial killings that have plagued London were committed by
    millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So, she gets to know him, and...well,
    I don''t know how much I can tell you without giving it away. But I can say that
    this is probably Allen''s funniest movie in years. There''s his ubiquitous unique
    style of humor (especially the line about his religion).<br /><br />So, you''re
    sure to like this movie. If nothing else, it''ll make you fall in love with London.
    But mostly, it''s just so damn hilarious. Even if you don''t like Woody Allen,
    you gotta love this one.'

I enjoyed it.<br /><br />People have skulls thicker than Ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate, and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories, and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself.

Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jack-of-all-trades. Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films. But there I was, all nestled in my theatre seat, popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball, were the words `Produced, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland'.

One of very few movies I couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing, "Deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and earns every iota of it. We need and deserve more movies like this!</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <code>In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "Ghost Train" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One can feel, moreover, the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth ...</code> | <code>1.0</code> |
  | <code>Not a bad martial arts film. Fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story worked without foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line to the story that works. IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and having strong women promenant. IT was definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <code>Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing, albeit, completely corny, to adults. Not a bad film for a low-budget job. Children will be amazed with Santa's workshop and the "magic" that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small, or homes that have no chimneys at all!<br /><br />Kids will thrill over the Santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named Pitch (complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. And what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas? In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, get just what they deserve for Christmas!<br /><br />The film ...</code> | <code>1.0</code> |
