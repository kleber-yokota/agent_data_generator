- source_sentence: Usually musicals in the 1940's were of a set formula - and if you
    studied films you know what I'm talking about - a certain running lenghth, very
    "showy" performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real
    personalities of the characters etc.<br /><br />THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT - and light
    years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year - 1945
    (although had no chance of beating the eventual winner - Lost Weekend).<br /><br
    />Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career - yes I know about "American
    in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This one is different. He really gets into
    his character of a "sea wolf" thinking (at first) that "picking up any girl while
    on leave" is nothing more than a lark. And if you had to make up a "story" to
    get her - so be it - until. Sort of like the Music Man when he gets "his foot
    caught in the door". The eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and
    his new pal (Sinatra)'s attempt to make the "story" good in order to "get the
    girl" that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love with. You are going to have
    to see the movie to see what I mean.<br /><br />Besides that there are so many
    other elements of great film in this one, it's a classic buddy story, nostalgia
    to a time when WWII was almost over (the war ended about a month after the films
    release), a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that
    he really is a great human being, great songs and probably a few other elements
    of classic film making that I can't think of right now.<br /><br />Why not a 10?
    Near the end - at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long. There is a small
    ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but
    seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now. But overall, this ones a
    definite winner on every level.
  sentences:
  - Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do
    not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance,
    there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are
    those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this
    movie called " The Last Wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent
    reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb
    the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney
    assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his
    own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal
    named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as
    Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught
    with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns
    of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives
    this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted,
    in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares
    of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****
  - Yes, as unbelievable as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for
    best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period,
    the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The
    difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that
    Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two movies are insipid
    wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver!. The acting is great; the
    songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. This movie is dynamic,
    topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New
    York, Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London, England that
    evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and
    he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and
    Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters
    who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
  - Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after
    a dog show.<br /><br />Usually I hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this)
    but I LOVE this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully
    directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the
    narrative along), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a locked
    room murder that was just incredible) and has a very good cast. <br /><br />Powell
    is very suave and great as Vance--he doesn't seem to be acting--he IS Vance! Mary
    Astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production.
    Everybody else is very good too, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective
    Heath. He's a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his lines
    were hilarious.<br /><br />Basically, an excellent 1930s Hollywood murder mystery.
    Well worth seeing.<br /><br />
- source_sentence: Anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in The
    Matrix has never seen this movie. The fight scenes were choreographed by action
    scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also did the fights in The Matrix. And the
    fight scenes are somethin.<br /><br />Li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain,
    who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (ya got me). When other evil supersoldiers
    begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade, Li teams up with
    his cop buddy to help stop them.<br /><br />There are some absolutely crazy things
    going on in this movie (one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass
    and hardly notices). The fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches;
    the body count is way up there. Li has seldom been better, and he has surrounded
    himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars (Yip kicks some serious ass as
    a fellow supersoldier). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no suprises
    there; he makes a cameo in every HK movie). It's unfortunate they don't make action
    movies like this in the US; I wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible
    dubbing jobs to see that action that I crave so much. Recommended.
  sentences:
  - 'Dreary. Schlocky. Just plain dreadful and awful. Let''s be honest, when you sit
    down to watch something called The Double-D Avenger you aren''t expecting great
    art or even mild mainstream entertainment. You are probably expecting a cult film
    type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts. You don''t get really
    either of these in the video. The story, as it consistent with most of these types,
    is inane: Kitten Natividad runs a local pub, finds out she has breast cancer,
    flies down to South America for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills
    and a super-human abilities giver, returns and fights, dressed as the Double-D
    Avenger, a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition.
    As stories go, I have seen a lot worse, but as another reviewer noted the execution
    is horrendous. The action sequences lack zip, drive, motivation, and are tissue
    thin. The acting isn''t even properly campy and the dialog is the pits. Nothing,
    and I mean NOTHING is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references.
    All could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it, but they all fall way
    short. Kitten, Haji, and Raven de la Croix are all quite older(still lovely in
    their own ways) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are
    trying to be: older, campy caricatures of their former selves. Instead, they look
    so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are "starring" in rather
    than their own abilities. There are some other lovely ladies, but you really do
    not see much of anything. PG -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for
    this. The material, the actresses, and director are all tired, tiresome, and dated
    - and again - NOT FUNNY! It was a brutal hour plus sitting through this, and that
    is a shame as I was expecting something campy and fun. The guy playing Bubba by
    the way was the only real laugh for me. Not that he was good at all mind you,
    but every time he opened his mouth I kept thinking how truly awful he was. The
    lone bright spot here at all is seeing Mr. Sci-fi himself, Forrest J. Ackerman,
    play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax Frankenstein affectionately
    called Frankie. Other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for
    another tired, dreadful, trite pun!'
  - 'Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing "Apocalypse
    Now" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /><br />You
    have to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" was
    thinking when he made this flabby film. It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle,
    playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing
    all of the things that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, the trooper
    that she is, does what she can with it, but this movie couldn''t be saved by anyone.<br
    /><br />It doesn''t even have any style to it, and, given its director, one would
    expect that even if it had nothing else, it would have that.<br /><br />Grade:
    C-'
  - Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this 1940 biopic of Mrs. Leslie
    Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne,
    and a fine cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory.<br
    /><br />Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was
    a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as
    the flamboyant, egotistical producer/writer/actor/impresario David Belasco, one
    of the great names in theater.<br /><br />Though Mrs. Carter's second husband,
    Lou Payne, served as adviser on this film, it's a poor representation of the real
    events of Mrs. Carter's life. True, there was a much publicized and bitter divorce,
    and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming
    an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody
    battle. Once she broke with Belasco, she did not go back to him and, in fact,
    started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her
    life. She did indeed marry Lou, and he became her leading man in many productions.<br
    /><br />The driving force for Mrs. Carter in the beginning of this film is regaining
    custody of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from him, he
    is thoroughly bonded with his father. In the film also (and I'm not sure if it
    was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical
    boarding house, which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere.<br /><br
    />Not a bad movie, probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter
    or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland,
    where she wore a wig with six-foot tresses. Off-stage, fans blew her hair as she
    hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing.
    Quite a visual.
- source_sentence: Most Hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience
    of teenagers. This film demonstrates exactly how to do it right. It combines elements
    of humour, suffering, rebellion, etc. in a way that is comlex & sympathetic. The
    ending could be a bit clearer, but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything
    out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes
    a more intelligent viewer.
  sentences:
  - The part of The Grinch was made for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with
    his performance. Not being a great fan of his I was apprehensive but pleasantly
    surprised with the outcome. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest little
    girl I have seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond
    her years in her acting skills. I was even drawn to tears at one point! I've never
    read the Dr Seuss book of the tale so I didnt know what to expect, the humour
    was quite dark. Overall,I enjoyed the film (apart from the songs!) and would recommend
    it, for family viewing especially.
  - 'Storyline: Max von Sydow''s voice-over narration hypnotizes the protagonist (and
    audience) back to 1945 where our protagonist the young American ideologist Leopold
    Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) has just arrived in post-WWII 1945 Germany to help rebuilding
    the damaged country. Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) supplies Leopold with
    a job in the big Zentropa train corporation, but soon Leopold falls in love with
    Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa); daughter of Zentropa owner Max Hartmann (Jørgen
    Reenberg). Leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption, being taken
    advantage of, losing his ideology, and is forced to chose between pest or colera.<br
    /><br />Mysterious, mesmerizing, manipulative, noirish, haunting, beautiful, and
    ugly. These are some immediate, grandiose, descriptions that come to mind when
    thinking of Lars von Trier''s 1991 masterpiece EUROPA; the final chapter of the
    Europa trilogy. In USA it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn''t confuse
    it with Agnieszka Holland''s EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 (equally a WWII drama). The
    Europa trilogy also consists of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984 and EPIDEMIC from
    1987 (the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the Danish cinemas).
    The trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism, although the
    themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals. In the opening-shot
    of EUROPA we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator
    literally hypnotizes us: "On the mental count of ten, you will be in Europa. Be
    there at ten. I say: ten". A metaphor for movies'' ability to transport us into
    a subconscious dream-reality.<br /><br />EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely
    effective visual style -- that famous Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky is Trier''s
    main-influence says it all. It''s a black-and-white movie occasionally intertwined
    with red in form of blood, a red dress etc. According to rumors this inspired
    Steven Spielberg to use the similar effect in SHINDLER''S LIST from 1993 (coincidentially
    another WWII drama). Furthermore Trier uses so-called Dutch angels and reinvents
    background-projection by adding separately shot co-operating layers upon layers,
    but unlike old Hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons, Trier
    uses it for artistic reasons. These carefully executed strange-looking visual
    techniques underline that we are in a dream-reality, we are hypnotized; the universe
    of EUROPA is not real! EUROPA is often criticized for weighing advanced technique
    (such as multi-layered background-projection) above plot and characters, but hey
    that''s what reviewers criticized Stanley Kubrick''s 1968 visual masterpiece 2001:
    A SPACE ODYSSEY for -- nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema-history
    books.<br /><br />EUROPA also gets accused of historical incorrectness. Apparently
    Trier assigns the Nazis'' Werewolf terrorist-group too much historical significance.
    According to various online-sources that''s correct (a fascinating subject - try
    Googl''ing it yourself!), yet Trier''s purposes are neither educational nor portraying
    history accurately. EUROPA is a never-ending nightmare. Leopold Kessler is hypnotized,
    therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality. Equally
    it shows how our memory deceives us -- a 100% accurate reconstruction is a lie!
    Although young audiences who experience EUROPA are too young to have memories
    from WWII, we have a collective memory of it from various BBC documentaries, so
    these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose: they inform us us that we are
    not in post-WWII Germany 1945, but in Leopolds memory of it.<br /><br />All three
    Europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced
    into corruption and losing their ideological innocence. The ambiguous endings
    of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT and EUROPA show the ideologists getting forever caught
    in their hypnotized realities. Before, during and after shooting EUROPA in 1990
    in Poland, Lars von Trier and co-writer Niels Vørsel were extremely interested
    in WWII. It shows. It''s packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere
    of the time-period spot-on. A great example is the old Polish church (EUROPA was
    shot in Poland primarily for economic reasons) in the last act of EUROPA. As with
    2001: SPACE ODYSSEY I think EUROPA will receive it''s rightfully deserved place
    in cinema-history. Its method of twisting old film-noir love-affair clichés and
    visual techniques is so unique, strange and completely different from anything
    you will see from Hollywood nowadays, or any other dream-factory for that matter.<br
    /><br />EUROPA is an essential movie in the Lars von Trier catalog. Some write
    it off as pure commercial speculation, but that would be catastrophic. It''s right
    up there with other Trier classics and semi-classics such as FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT
    from 1984, the TV-series RIGET from 1993 and DOGVILLE from 2003. It''s a unique
    experience from before Trier cared for his actors, and before the Dogme95 Manifesto.
    Watch it! "On the count of ten..." 9/10'
  - People criticise Disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy,
    set in landscapes that are much too pristine. That criticism is just. And yet
    it can't be the whole story, because the two least glossy - "Alice in Wonderland"
    and "Peter Pan" - are also the weakest. "Cinderella", on the other hand, set in
    a world in which the very dirt sparkles, is clearly the best.<br /><br />It DOES
    look good. The backgrounds are subtle and consistent; the colours are pure without
    being too bright. The animation varies a bit. I'll swear that some of the humans
    are rotoscoped - but then, the rotoscoped humans (including Cinderella herself)
    aren't full-blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well enough.
    It's really the animals that make the movie. I think the studio had never quite
    used animals in this way before, as totems rather than sidekicks. The mice, for
    instance, are the creatures who draw us into the story; but they are really representatives
    or allies of the more colourless Cinderella. The cat, Lucifer, is a kind of witch's
    familiar to the Wicked Stepmother. (The cat is brilliantly conceived and animated
    - one of the best feline creations of all time. The supervising animator was Ward
    Kimball and he modelled it on his own cat. I wonder how he put up with the animal.)
    This approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention
    from the main story. Their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of
    the main story.<br /><br />Among the supporting cast the notable humans are the
    King and the Grand Duke. The King is a one note character - he wants grandchildren
    and appears to have no other desires at all - but the note is struck in a pleasing
    fashion. The Grand Duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out
    of his sphere as much as Cinderella does. (Although he, of course, is richer.)<br
    /><br />"Cinderella" is Disney's return to features after an eight-year hiatus,
    and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance
    of his early years. Moreover he made things hard for himself by picking "Cinderella".
    She's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that. (Maybe
    I'm wrong on this score - I haven't seen the recent "Ever After".) Nonetheless
    it is remarkable how successful Disney was in bringing this unpromising story
    to life, without cutting across the grain of its spirit.
- source_sentence: 'As I watched one of Orson Welles'' last contributions to Hollywood
    as a filmmaker, I knew I was watching a great movie unfold, though at times I
    did not know why. The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of
    a film-noir: average-Joe lead, femme fatale, conspicuous supporting characters,
    and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure. It is an entertaining
    ride, and it''s filled to the brim with Welles'' unique gifts as a director, but
    there are scenes that tend to just not work, or don''t feel complete in what was
    Welles'' full vision (the latter is unfortunately too true- executive producer
    Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for that).<br /><br />Welles co-stars
    with his then wife, the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth, as Mike O''Hara, an
    Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people. Hayworth is Mrs.
    Bannister, married to Mr. Bannister (Everett Sloane, who played Mr. Bernstein
    in Citizen Kane), who is accompanied by a friend Mr. Grisby (Glenn Anders, who
    has great control in his eyes). They want to go sailing on their yacht and take
    O''Hara along for the ride, and at first he''s reluctant, but agrees since he''s
    falling for the married Mrs. As their journey unfolds, O''Hara finds that Bannister
    and Grisby are not pleasant to be around, and more so with Grisby, who at first
    seems out of his gourd. Yet as the plot unfolds, O''Hara is drawn into a scam
    that Grisby is planning for insurance money, with results that I dare not reveal
    (although they have been discussed over and over by others).<br /><br />Whatever
    liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story (and those
    few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated), the performances and
    the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty-five years. Though
    he doesn''t have the terrific Greg Tolland (Kane''s DP) at his side, dependable
    Charles Lawton Jr. assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant
    and stark, covered in shadows, deep focus, low angles, the works. A particular
    accomplishment is the fun-house mirror scene, which is merely a highlight among
    others. Welles himself is always dependable as an actor- even if his accent isn''t
    anything special- and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush, despite
    her path in the story. <br /><br />The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out,
    especially for Welles, Hayworth, or film-noir buffs (fans of the Coen brothers
    might find this fascinating as well). It may just take a little while, repeat
    viewings (as was for Touch of Evil), for the underlying motives in the plot to
    sink in.'

    seemed to in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit was some clever dialog
    in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I did

    other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel free.<br /><br />p.s another

  - It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound
    era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary. At times there is
    almost a desperation, as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings
    at sound, surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside (as did happen
    to some), Rin-Tin-Tin. however, was pertfectly natural. In such a vaudeville of
    unrelated sequences, some were sure to stand out John Barrymore's soliloquy from
    Richard II is a moment certainly worth preserving. By and large, only those with
    earlier stage training exuded confidence. However, this is over all reasonably
    entertaining, and a must for "film buffs" especially interested in the silent
    to sound transition
- source_sentence: 'In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decide
    to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard. In
    1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar British
    Film Genre- the Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within
    (1959).<br /><br />The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched.
    There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds
    to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn''t give way for unlikely
    drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. It is utterly
    of its time and works beautifully.<br /><br />Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David
    Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (I suspect) non-actors.
    Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. They keep emotion
    out of their roles. As so many were, until recently, ex-service, I suspect they
    recreated their war time roles as ''Officers and Gentlemen''.<br /><br />This
    unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary,
    unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story doesn''t end at the barbed wire: and
    that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.'

  - '"the day time ended" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it''s better than
    "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big
    budget spectaculars.) the special effects ARE cheesy, but that''s a big part of
    the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it''s probably
    one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good.
    the story DOESN''T make sense. BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING.
    like many of the best works of art, "the day time ended" isn''t afraid to be subtle
    and ambiguous. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn''t
    too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" European films of the
    fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)'
  - 'Just a comment on New Orleans accents...<br /><br />An earlier reviewer noted
    the following: "This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern
    big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like "broklynese"
    than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country." There
    was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer.<br /><br
    />Many people in New Orleans do, in fact, sound "broklynese". I have never found
    out why. (It''s mentioned in "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole.)
    I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail,
    as this one did. Too often it''s just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern
    accent.'

    "In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decide to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar British Film Genre- the Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959).<br /><br />The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. It is utterly of its time and works beautifully.<br /><br />Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. They keep emotion out of their roles. As so many were, until recently, ex-service, I suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'Officers and Gentlemen'.<br /><br />This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story doesn't end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.",
    '"the day time ended" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it\'s better than "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects ARE cheesy, but that\'s a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it\'s probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story DOESN\'T make sense. BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING. like many of the best works of art, "the day time ended" isn\'t afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn\'t too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)',
    "there should be a sub-genre in the Western called 'the Robert Mitchum Western'. Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually undervalued Westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches, and bring an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpah. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson, it is a stark, monochrome beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer, with a host of dark emotions in between, is a marvel of expressive, physical acting.",

  | <code>It's a shame that Deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for Dueling Banjos. Even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. People tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene.<br /><br />The acting, plot, cinematography, and soundtrack of Deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma. The backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter. The actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them. <br /><br />The thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires. Not many films can make you feel this creeped out. Bottom Line: This movie is a classic. I can't really say much more than that.</code> | <code>Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.<br /><br />The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting " None Shall Pass" and " It's only a flesh wound, I've had worse". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year.<br /><br />The "gladiator/demon" was a stitch too. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. Kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.<br /><br /></code> | <code>0.0</code> |
  | <code>This is a very exciting and romantic film. I have seen it several times and never get bored with it. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox.<br /><br />I actually prefer this film to Braveheart as Braveheart contain so many historical misstakes. There is many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene. This is really good and surprising scenes.<br /><br />The music are lovely...it really suits to the movie. The setting is amazing.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <code>This movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes.
